== Frequently Asked Questions ==

This plugin was especially designed for flexibility and it is very easy to use. We don't expect you to encounter serious issues, but we included a list with some logical questions that you may find useful.

1.  How can I create a poll?        

	*  Go to your YOP Poll menu and select the "Add New" option.    

	*  Fill the required information according to the examples we included: name, question, answers (add additional ones if you need), select the start/end date for your poll, and decide on the advanced settings for results, votes, voters, accessibility etc.   

	*  Once you decided on all your poll details, click on "Save".   

	*  To view your new poll access "All Polls" from your main menu and choose the corresponding entry from the list.   


2.  How can I link a poll to my webpage?     

	*  Find out the ID assigned to poll by accessing "All Polls".   
	   Locate your poll and notice the ID on the left, before the name section.   

	*  Copy the following shortcode and paste it in your page: [yop_poll id="ID"]   
           For instance, if the poll you want to display has the ID=15 the code will be: [yop_poll id="15"].   

	*  This is it. Check your page or post now.   


3.  Do you have some predefined shortcodes that I can use?    

	Yes.       

	Current Active Poll ID = -1:   [yop_poll id="-1"]      

	Latest Poll id = -2:           [yop_poll id="-2"]

5.  Can I ask for additional information from my voters?       

	Yes, you can customize your poll to request additional information. Eg. name, email, age, profession. To include this, when you create your poll using the "Add New" form, go to "Custom Text Fields" -> "Add new custom field" and include as many requests as you need.   


6.  How can I create/modify a template?      

	*  Access the "Templates" menu.     
	
	*  If you want to create a new template use the "Add new" option and include the corresponding HTML/visual code.

	*  Below the name of the poll you have several options.       

	*  Use the "Results" link to track the results of the poll,      

	*  or access the "Logs" for a more detailed evaluation. 


8.  What is the difference between Options and Poll Options for each poll?      

	*  Options (located under plugin menu) is the way to specifify general settings for all your polls.     
	
	*  If you want to go further and customize each poll, these settings will take precedence over Options settings.

	*  To do this, in your wordpress go to Plugins->Editor.

10.  How can I see the results after the poll ends?      

	*  Edit your poll and in "View Results:" choose "After Poll End Date" and save.       


11.  How can I add a Poll Archive page on my website?      

	*  From your WordPress menu create a new page that contains [yop_poll_archive] and has the permalink http://www.yourwebsite.com/polls/
